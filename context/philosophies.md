## 1. Player-Centered Approach (PCA)

### Section 1: Core Definition & Role
* **Description:** The Player-Centered Approach shifts the focus from the coach’s knowledge to the players’ understanding and empowerment. In this philosophy, the primary goal is to develop independent decision-makers who take ownership of their learning journey. The environment is democratic, encouraging players to solve problems, contribute to strategy, and analyze their own performance, resulting in deeper cognitive engagement and long-term retention of skills.
* **Coach Role:**
    * **Facilitator:** Guides discovery rather than dictating answers.
    * **Questioner:** Uses "how," "why," and "what if" questions to stimulate thinking.
    * **Mentor:** Supports personal growth and leadership within the squad.
    * **Listener:** Actively validates player input and adjusts sessions based on feedback.

### Section 2: Session Plan Generation Principles
* **Inquiry-Based Learning:** The session plan must include specific "Questioning Breaks" rather than "Instruction Blocks," prompting the coach to ask open-ended questions.
* **Co-Design Elements:** Allocate time segments where players determine the specific starting conditions or tactical solutions for a drill/game.
* **Problem-Solving Focus:** Activities must present a tactical problem to solve (e.g., "How do we overlap on the edge?") rather than a technical movement to replicate.
* **Peer Feedback:** Structure breaks to allow players to discuss solutions in "huddles" before the coach intervenes.

### Section 3: Key Assessment Metrics (For AI Analysis)

| Metric (KPI) | Definition/Goal | Assessment Scale (1-5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ratio of High-Order Questions** | *Measures the proportion of open-ended (Why/How) questions vs. closed (Yes/No) commands.* | *1 = Mostly commands/instruction; 5 = Dominant use of divergent questioning.* |
| **Player Talk Time/Input** | *Estimates the volume of time allocated for player discussion, feedback, and co-design.* | *1 = Coach talks >80%; 5 = Balanced dialogue or Player talk > Coach talk.* |
| **Session Variety Score** | *Evaluates the diversity of activities to maintain engagement and cognitive stimulation.* | *1 = Monotonous/Repetitive drills; 5 = High variety in stimuli and activity types.* |

## 2. Constraints-Led Approach (CLA)

### Section 1: Core Definition & Role
* **Description:** Rooted in Ecological Dynamics, the Constraints-Led Approach focuses on the relationship between the Performer, the Task, and the Environment. Rather than verbal instruction, the coach manipulates these three constraints to allow skills and tactical behaviors to "emerge" naturally. The goal is to improve adaptability and perception-action coupling by practicing in representative environments (games) rather than isolated drills.
* **Coach Role:**
    * **Environment Architect:** Designing the practice space to invite specific behaviors.
    * **Constraint Designer:** Modifying rules, equipment, or numbers to shape play.
    * **Observer:** Watching for emergent behaviors and holding back on immediate correction.
    * **Adjuster:** Tweaking constraints live if the desired outcome isn't appearing.

### Section 2: Session Plan Generation Principles
* **Representative Learning Design:** The plan must prioritize Game-Based Learning (GBL) and Small-Sided Games (SSG) over static line drills.
* **Constraint Manipulation:** Instructions must focus on changing rules (e.g., "3 seconds to pass," "narrow pitch") rather than correcting body mechanics.
* **Variability:** The plan should introduce "repetition without repetition"—practicing the same concept (e.g., drift defense) under constantly changing scenarios.
* **Minimal Stoppage:** Flow must be prioritized; coaching interventions should be "on the fly" or between play sets.

### Section 3: Key Assessment Metrics (For AI Analysis)

| Metric (KPI) | Definition/Goal | Assessment Scale (1-5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Number of Rule/Space Modifications** | *Counts specific changes to task constraints (pitch size, scoring rules, player numbers).* | *1 = Standard rules only; 5 = Frequent, purposeful constraint manipulation.* |
| **Game-to-Drill Time Ratio** | *Measures the percentage of session time spent in opposed, chaotic games vs. unopposed drills.* | *1 = <20% Game time; 5 = >80% Game time (Representative Design).* |
| **Decision-Making Opportunities** | *Quantifies the frequency of moments where a player must make a live choice (Read-React).* | *1 = Linear/Rote execution; 5 = Constant read-react scenarios.* |

## 3. Coach-Centered/Autocratic

### Section 1: Core Definition & Role
* **Description:** This traditional philosophy relies on the coach as the primary source of knowledge and authority. It prioritizes discipline, structure, and the precise execution of specific techniques or tactical blueprints. While often viewed as rigid, it is effective for safety instruction, installing complex set-piece plays, or managing large groups where immediate compliance and uniformity are required.
* **Coach Role:**
    * **Commander:** Issues clear, direct orders to manage the group.
    * **Instructor:** Provides explicit technical detail and "perfect model" demonstrations.
    * **Director:** Choreographs the exact movement of players.
    * **Corrector:** Identifies errors immediately and provides specific corrective feedback.

### Section 2: Session Plan Generation Principles
* **Explicit Instruction:** The plan must include detailed technical scripts and "key teaching points" for the coach to deliver verbally.
* **High Repetition:** Activities must focus on "grooving" a technique through massed practice (blocking) before moving to the next skill.
* **Structured Progression:** The session follows a linear `Warm-up -> Drill A -> Drill B -> Scrimmage` format with strict time adherence.
* **Compliance Checks:** The plan should prompt the coach to stop and correct whenever execution deviates from the ideal model.

### Section 3: Key Assessment Metrics (For AI Analysis)

| Metric (KPI) | Definition/Goal | Assessment Scale (1-5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ratio of Instructions/Directives** | *Measures the volume of explicit commands and technical corrections provided by the coach.* | *1 = Low direction (laissez-faire); 5 = High frequency of direct instruction.* |
| **Task Compliance Score** | *Evaluates how strictly the session demands adherence to a specific movement model or pattern.* | *1 = High freedom/exploration; 5 = Strict adherence to the model required.* |
| **Repetition Count/Specificity** | *Measures the volume of identical or near-identical technical repetitions planned.* | *1 = High variability/random practice; 5 = High volume blocked practice.* |

## 4. Holistic/Well-Being Focused

### Section 1: Core Definition & Role
* **Description:** The Holistic philosophy operates on the principle of "Person before Player." It recognizes that rugby performance is inextricably linked to mental health, emotional safety, and life balance. The primary goal is to create a psychologically safe environment where players feel valued and understood, fostering resilience and long-term participation in the sport.
* **Coach Role:**
    * **Mentor/Caregiver:** Prioritizes emotional support and life guidance.
    * **Culture Builder:** Fosters a sense of belonging and psychological safety.
    * **Connector:** Links rugby skills to life skills (e.g., resilience, teamwork).
    * **Empathetic Observer:** Monitors mood, body language, and energy levels.

### Section 2: Session Plan Generation Principles
* **Check-In/Check-Out Protocols:** Every session must begin and end with a structured wellness check or team circle (e.g., "Red/Amber/Green" status).
* **Individual Development Plans (IDP):** Drills should explicitly reference how they help specific players achieve their personal goals.
* **Psychological Safety Prompts:** The plan must include reminders for the coach to praise effort and validate feelings, not just outcomes.
* **Social Connection:** Warm-ups or cool-downs must include "relatedness" activities designed to build bonds between teammates (fun/playful).

### Section 3: Key Assessment Metrics (For AI Analysis)

| Metric (KPI) | Definition/Goal | Assessment Scale (1-5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Well-Being Check-in Integration** | *Checks for the presence of explicit time dedicated to mental/emotional state assessment.* | *1 = No check-in; 5 = Structured start/end check-ins included.* |
| **Relatedness Score** | *Measures activities designed specifically to improve team cohesion and interpersonal bonds.* | *1 = Purely transactional training; 5 = Specific team-building integrated.* |
| **Goal Alignment (IDP)** | *Evaluates how well session activities link to previously stated individual player goals.* | *1 = Generic session; 5 = Explicit links to player IDPs.* |
